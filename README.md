URsiM is an Unlimited Register Machine Simulator, developed with Bun to aid students and teachers.

This simulator implements the following instructions:

S(R) - Adds 1 to the register R
Z(R) - Sets the register R to 0
T(R1, R2) - Transfers the value from R1 to R2
J(R1,R2,I) - Jumps to instruction I if the value in R1 equals the value in R2

Semi-colons are optional at the end of a line. Comments can be defined with the # keyword.
